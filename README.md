# Exercise_Unit5_website
In this repository I am going to do work on the branches in git hub.
First: I will create a public repository on github with a README.md file.
Second: I will create an html file in which I will create a website.
Third: I will add an image to this file.
Fourth: I will modify the footer.
Fifth: I will create a branch.
Sixth: I will modify the file in both branches so that there is a conflict and then solve it and join the branches again. Finally I will publish it in my repository.
